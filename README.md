# Cancer-TMB-MSI

## Overview
Microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) are predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy in most cancers. However, the relationship between MSI-high (MSI-H) and TMB-high (TMB-H) in human cancers is unclear, and their predictive value for immunotherapy in lung cancer is uncertain.

RESULTS: A substantial proportion of MSI-H patients had TMB-low phenotypes across 22 cancer types, ranging from 31% to 89%. Despite these discrepancies, the strongest associations between TMB and MSI were observed in colorectal and stomach cancers, whereas marginal or no associations were observed in several other cancers. Among lung cancer patients who received immunotherapy treatment, those in the TMB-H group exhibited significantly higher overall survival rates (hazard ratio of 0.61, 95% CI: 0.44–0.86) and progression-free survival (0.65, 95% CI: 0.47–0.91) compared to the TMB-low group, while no significant difference was observed in the MSI-H group. In addition, we identified several mutated genes associated with MSI-H phenotypes, including known mismatch repair genes and novel mutated genes such as ARID1A and ARID1B.

CONCLUSION: Our study provides compelling evidence that TMB-H, but not MSI-H, could potentially serve as a biomarker for immunotherapies in cases of lung cancer. The findings suggest that distinct or combined biomarkers should be considered for immunotherapies in human cancers, as significant discrepancies were observed between MSI-H and TMB-H in various cancer types.

## Methods
 We analyzed somatic mutation data from the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (n=46,320) to investigate the relationship between MSI-H and TMB-H in human cancers. Associations between TMB and MSI were evaluated using adjusted multivariable linear regression models. Patient survival analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazards model. We also assessed the relationship between MSI and gene mutations.
